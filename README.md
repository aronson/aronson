## Hi there 👋 I'm Aronson, a developer in Chicago

I'm 31 years old and have been programming since I was eight years old -- my first language was LOGO with Turtle graphics.

I work on a wide variety of projects ranging from video game development, AIs to play them, to retro console toolchain internals, low-level C and ASM libraries, and even large projects such as the Simple DirectMedia Layer.

I'm a contributor to a bunch of repos and love to share the FOSS love wherever I go. FOSS was how I got to where I am today, and I want to pay it forward wherever I can.

## 💡 Interests & Expertise

- Improving code performance in critical, hot-paths
  - I use SIMD in SSE 4.2, AVX(+2), and NEON to beat GCC and clang routinely
- Retro and modern console video game development, I have software shipped on:
  - GameBoy Advance
  - Nintendo DS
  - Nintendo 3DS
  - Playstation Vita
  - Playstation Portable
  - Nintendo Switch
- Toolchain development
  - I ported [Wonderful Toolchain](https://wonderful.asie.pl) to macOS
  - I work with [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com) to target dozens of platforms in a single codebase
- Multiplayer software
  - I work on [Apotris](https://apotris.com) where we support true multiplatform multiplayer between up to 5 players
  - I dream of supporting 256 players in a single session
  - I work on both traditional TCP/UDP netcode as well as GBA Wireless Adapters, Link Cables, NDS RFU, PS Vita Ad-Hoc, and more!
- FPGA development
  - I integrated SNAC GBA EXT port hardware with a forked MiSTer-FPGA core to connect the FPGA to a real console via link cable (this work is unreleased due to incompatible licensing)
  - I've backported a number of fixes from the GBA 1P core to the GBA 2P core
  - I added the GBA Video ("Shrek") movie mapper to a GBA core
  - I ported the itself-ported GBATang FPGA core (a fork/port of GBA-MiSTer to Tang) back to MiSTer which greatly improved emulation accuracy in test suites
  - I have dreams of an NDS core but I think the DE-10 Nano FPGA may be at its limit for NDS
- (V)LM development
  - I was a brief contributor to MLX-LM and work to engineer my own harnesses for agents
  - I work in the scene to add safeties and bias out copyrighted content wherever I can to ensure ethical generation
  - I support grassroots communities of independent model engineers to empower users to avoid closed-source and corporate-controlled models in favor of local models with open weights and massively reduced power utilization


## 🔭 What I'm Up To

- I work freelance on various social media and ML projects
- I'm working to complete the Apotris multiplayer experience
- I'm wrapping up and shipping out my Eden Toolchain as an alternative to devkitPro
