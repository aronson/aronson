## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Heni, a developer in Chicago

I'm 31 years old and have been programming since I was eight years old -- my first language was LOGO with Turtle graphics.

I work on a wide variety of projects ranging from video game development, AIs to play them, to retro console toolchain internals, low-level C and ASM libraries, and even large projects such as the Simple DirectMedia Layer.

I'm a contributor to a bunch of repos and love to share the FOSS love wherever I go. FOSS was how I got to where I am today, and I want to pay it forward wherever I can.
